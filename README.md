Feeling writer's block? Hit <Tab> and an artificial neural network running in your browser will finish your sentence as if it were written by Shakespeare, the US Supreme Court, or Tupac Shakur.

This project was inspired by Robin Sloan's rnn-writer, and is powered by [TensorFire](https://tenso.rs/) and CodeMirror. It's built by [Kevin Kwok](https://twitter.com/antimatter15), Guillermo Webster, Anish Athalye, and Logan Engstrom.
