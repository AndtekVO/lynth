# Cyborg Writer

This is an experimental text editor with an embedded neural text synthesizer. 
This goal here is not to replace human authors, but to augment them in ways 
that help escape writer's block and produce more novel work.

This project was inspired by Robin Sloan's rnn-writer, and powered by TensorFire 
and CodeMirror. It's built by Kevin Kwok (@antimatter15), and the TensorFire team.
